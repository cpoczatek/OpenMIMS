== Introduction and Installation ==

The NRIMS Analysis Module is an ImageJ plugin to open, process and analyze images captured with NanoSIMS 50
& 50L secondary ion mass spectrometers (Cameca). The plugin has been developed at the National Resource for
Imaging Mass Spectrometry (NRIMS, http://www.nrims.hms.harvard.edu), an NIH-supported National Resource
developing Multi-isotope Imaging Mass Spectrometry (MIMS) for biomedical research. Images and/or stacks of
images for up to 7 different isotopes can be opened, analyzed and saved. All metadata saved in the original file are preserved. Image ratios and Hue-Saturation-Intensity (HSI) maps of any combination of isotopes can be displayed and data from any number of Regions of Interest (ROIs) extracted, analyzed and tabulated for single images or entire stacks.

After downloading the Open MIMS.zip from (http://www.nrims.hms.harvard.edu/software.php) copy all the extracted contents to the ImageJ home ’plugins’ folder and restart ImageJ. Note this plugin requires a 1.43u or later
version of ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download.html) and Java 1.6.

__TOC__

== Opening MIMS images ==

After launching ImageJ, place the mouse over the “Plugins” menu option and select the “Open MIMS Image” option.
This action will open the OpenMIMS graphical user interface. You then open an image by clicking “File > Open
MIMS Image” and navigate to the desired MIMS image file (files with a .im, .nrrd extension). Files can also be
opened by dragging and dropping the file from a file browser. Only .nrrd files generated by the OpenMIMS plugin
are guaranteed to be readable by the plugin. After the MIMS image is opened, each mass will appear in a separate
window (example below) as well as the NRIMS Analysis Module window.

== Graphical Interface ==
The NRIMS Analysis Module window contains 7 tabs:
* '''MIMS Data:''' Displays metadata and other information for the current file.
* '''Process:''' Used to generate ratio images and HSI maps.
* '''Contrast:''' Controls the contrast and brightness settings for mass, ratio and sum images.
* '''Stack Editing:''' Used for manipulating the mass images (applying x and y translations, dropping planes, etc).
* '''Tomography:''' Basic plotting of statistics for whole images or ROIs.
* '''Segmentation:''' Perform an algorithmic segmentation of an image.
* '''MIMS Log:''' Displays more header metadata and a record of the user’s actions and debug output.

=== MIMS Data ===

The '''MIMS Data''' tab displays a subset of the image’s meta-data including the absolute path of the current image,
the number of masses and their AMU values, number of planes in the stack, position, date of image, user name,
dwell time, duration, raster size and image size. The '''Synchronize Stacks''' check box enables updating of all masses
simultaneously while scrolling through an image stack. Adjusting the slider (plane selector) at the bottom of any
mass automatically selects the same plane for all masses.

[[Image:Snapshot_MimsData.png|frame|center|alt=The MIMS Data tab displays file information and meta data.
|The '''MIMS Data''' tab displays file information and meta data.]]

=== Process ===

The '''Process''' tab allows the user to generate ratio images and HSI maps. Ratio and HSI images are the result
of dividing one mass image by another. Masses that have similar masses will automatically show up in list form in
the '''Process''' tab. Others that do not show up by default can be entered manually using the '''Add...''' button. A
ratio image will appear when the user selects one (or more) in the list and clicks '''Display Ratio'''. When moving the
mouse pointer over the ratio image, the status box along the lower border of the NRIMS Analysis Module window
displays the raw numerator and denominator counts as well as the ratio value.

HSI images are similar to ratio images but are different in that they use a combination of the the ratio value of
a pixel, the counts of one of the masses for the intensity, and a constant saturation value, to generate pixels in the
RGB color space. Clicking the '''Display HSI''' will make the selected HSI image appear. An example HSI image is
provided in [[#Appendices|Appendix A]]. When displaying HSI images, the user has the option of displaying the actual ratio
values (multiplied by the '''Ratio Scale Factor''') or displaying percent turnover by selecting the '''Percent Turnover'''
radio button. Percent turnover is determined by the naturally occurring ratio of that specific isotopic pair along
with the maximum achievable ratio based on the experimental protocol.

The '''Threshold''' option sets the minimum number of counts in the numerator and/or denominator. Any pixels
below that threshold will be ignored and appear black. The '''Ratio Range Min''' and '''Max''' values determine the
range of the colormap used to display the image. The '''RGB Min''' and '''RGB Max''' values determine the intensity
scale used in the image. The '''Transparency''' selects the method for computing the intensity component of the HSI
image, and the '''Label''' option enables a color scale bar to be become visible. Selecting the '''Use Sum''' radio button will
generate a single HSI (or ratio) image representative of the entire stack. Selecting the '''Use Window''' radio button
will use the sum of both masses over a sliding window with the specified window size. This can be very useful for
finding small features in large image stacks that have low counts. Also, a median filter can be applied to a ratio or
HSI image by selecting the '''Median Filter Ratio''' radio button.

=== Contrast ===

The '''Contrast''' tab allows the user to control the contrast settings, by adjusting the sliders, for any given mass,
ratio or sum image (HSI images do not have contrast settings, instead their display parameters are controlled using
the '''Process''' tab). It also displays a histogram of intensity values for any of these types of images. Clicking on an
image brings it into focus and the histogram and contrast settings will update to reflect the values of the current
image in focus. The histogram and contrast settings will also update by selecting the window in the combobox
located at the bottom of the '''Contrast''' tab. All mass, ratio and sum images should appear in the combobox.

If changes to the default contrast settings are made, clicking the '''Reset''' button will bring those settings back
to their default values. Clicking '''Auto''' will iterate through a set (usually 5 or 6) of contrast settings, eventually
returning back to default values. The '''Set''' button allows the user to input values for min and max that are outside
the range of those provided by the '''Minimum''' and '''Maximum''' sliders.

Mass, ratio and sum images can also be set to '''Auto Adjus'''t meaning that each time a new slice is selected in
the stack, new contrast settings are calculated. If '''Auto Adjust''' is not selected, the contrast settings for the first
image in the stack are used throughout the stack.

The user has the additional capability of displaying the image using '''Lookup Tables''' other than the gray table
used by default. There are several options for displaying the data and each image can be set independently.

=== Stack Editing ===

The '''Stack Editing''' tab is reserved for functions that relate to the editing and manipulating of mass images. This
includes deleting and reinserting planes, applying translation, compressing the image and generating sum images.
One important thing to note is that there are two indices for an image, both of which are displayed: '''True index''' and
'''Display index'''. The True index of a plane in an image never changes, but the Display index depends on what planes
have been deleted. For example: entering 1-5 and clicking the '''Delete''', then entering 6-10, and clicking Delete will
-not- delete the first 10 planes of an image. Doing that is equivalent to entering 1-5, 11-15 and clicking '''Delete'''. The
'''Reinsert''' button uses the indices of the original data, so entering entering 1-5, 11-15 would reinsert the previously
deleted planes.

A plane that is currently displayed can be translated using the '''Translate X''' or '''Translate Y''' spinners, or by
entering a value those text fields. The image can also be registered automatically by clicking on a specific mass to use
and then clicking the '''Autotrack''' button. This will call the autotrack algorithm which will automatically attempt
to determine the best per image translations for a best fit alignment throughout the stack. Clicking '''Untrack''' will
reset all translations to zero.

The '''Concatenate''' button allows another image (or image stack) to be prepended or appended to the current
image set. The '''Sum''' button will generate a sum image from whichever mass image or ratio image was most recently
clicked. If the field is blank the entire image is summed, or a range of planes can be entered in the textfield (e.g.
1-20). The '''Compress''' button compresses the images into blocks of the size entered in the text field. Entering a value
of 4 in the field will sum the pixel values in blocks of 4 planes, resulting in a stack of images 1/4 the original size. Any
remaining planes at the end of the stack are summed together into a single block. The '''Uncompress''' button undoes
the compression and restores the image to its original state - minus any translations applied and planes deleted.

[[Image:Snapshot_MimsStackEditing.png‎|frame|center|alt=The Stack Editing tab is used for image manipulation.|The '''Stack Editing''' tab is used for image manipulation.]]

=== Tomography ===

The '''Tomography''' tab allows the user to generate simple line plots or tables of ROI statistics through the stack.
Simply select a set of ROIs from the '''ROI Manager''', the desired statistics, and the mass, ratio and/or sum images
and click '''Plot''' or '''Table'''. The '''Planes''' field allows the user to enter which planes are included in the plot (or table).
If this field is left blank, all planes will be included. Checking the '''Append''' box will append the data to an existing
plot or table if one exists, otherwise a new one will be created.

[[Image:Snapshot_MimsTomography.png|frame|center|alt=The Tomography tab is used to generate plots and tables of ROI statistics.|The '''Tomography''' tab is used to generate plots and tables of ROI statistics.]]

An example of the type of plot produced can be seen

<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!-- -->

The table output will vary depending on the type of images for which statistics are being generating. Mass and
ratio images that are more than one plane will output one row of data per plane. In the case of sum images and
other images that are only one plane, one row of data will be produced per ROI. See [[#Appendices|Appendix B]] for a sample data
output table.

The right side of the tab includes a histogram that displays the intensity values for the pixels within a given ROI.
To set which ROI values are displayed by the histogram, the user only needs to scroll the mouse over the desired
ROI. After a ROI has been drawn, it can be moved anywhere within the image by either dragging it with the mouse,
or using the position spinners in the '''ROI Manager'''. If the '''Autoupdate Histogram''' radio button is selected, the
histogram will update as the ROI is being moved by the mouse. Otherwise, it updates when the move is complete.

A line ROI represents a special case because it has no enclosed area, so its values will not be represented in the
histogram. Instead, the user can select the '''Dynamic Profile''' button to generate a profile plot of the pixels which
the line intersects. An example of a mass image with a line ROI and its profile plot is provided below.

=== Segmentation ===

The '''Segmentation''' tab allows the user to perform an algorithmic segmentation of a MIMS image to automatically
generate ROIs for a given image plane. The algorithm used is a support vector machine (SVM) based segmentation
that classifies pixels in the image using methods similar to ''Fuller et. al.'' 
<ref>Fuller et. al. ''Segmentation of Three-dimensional Retinal Image Data.'' IEEE Trans. Vis. Comput. Graph.
16(6):1719-1726, 2007.</ref>. A full description of SVMs is outside the
scope of this document but will be detailed in a forthcoming paper. The algorithm can use many values or features
to classify a pixel: the value of that pixel in a set of mass or ratio images, the mean and standard deviation in a
neighborhood around that pixel, and the gradient around that pixel. Note that the ability to use other features may
be added later. To perform a segmentation the user clicks on the '''Config''' button and is presented with the '''SVM configuration GUI'''. 
The '''Export''' button will export the SVM and data if the SVM has been trained using the
libSVM format.

<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!-- -->

[[Image:Snapshot_MimsSegmentation.png|frame|center|alt=The Segementation tab.|The '''Segementation''' tab.]]


Here the user may select which mass and ratio images to use for the segmentation (segmentation can not be
performed on Sum images). One can choose whether or not to use the '''Neighborhood''' parameters (mean and
standard deviation) and the '''Gradient''' as features, as well as the size of the neighborhood radius. Some parameters
used by the SVM library (in our case libSVM <ref>libSVM http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/cjlin/libsvm</ref>
) can be changed by clicking the '''Setup''' button, specifically the type of kernel to
use and the level of cross validation. We recommend using the radial basis function (RBF ) as the kernel. The level
of cross validation may be reduced to increase speed at the possible cost of accuracy.

To train the SVM the user needs to choose at least several ROIs that represent a given class of pixels. First a
class is added to the '''Class Manager''' by clicking the '''Add''' button. Then the representative ROIs are drawn. Then
the '''Sync''' button is clicked to sync the ROIs in the '''ROI Manger''' to the class in the '''Class Manager'''. Finally the
users clicks the '''Ok''' button to complete the SVM configuration.

<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!-- -->

[[Image:Snapshot_Model_Config.png|frame|center|alt=SVM configuration GUI.|SVM configuration GUI.]]


The SVM must be trained by clicking the '''Train''' button, located below '''Model description''' in the '''Segmentation''' tab. It
should be noted that the SVM can be saved either before training (saving all parameter settings and training ROIs)
or after training (also saving the trained SVM). The segmentation of the entire image can be performed by clicking
Predict and the result of this prediction can be shown by clicking Display. Currently the SVM only segments 2D
images. Generating ROIs from the prediction can be done by clicking ROIs which will generate a set of ROIs for
each class ignoring groups of pixels of the same class that are below the value in the min area field. An example of
a segmentation can be seen in [[#Appendices|Appendix C]].


=== MIMS Log ===

The '''MIMS Log''' tab keeps a record of what the user has done: e.g. deleting planes, translating planes, auto-
tracking, etc. Various bits of degub data are also displayed on this tab. This information is not saved and is most
likely of little use to the most users.

== ROI Manager ==

The ROI Manager (see below) gives the user functionality relating the ROIs in a given image. It is comprised of
two lists, one labeled '''Groups''' and one labeled '''Rois''', as well as a panel on the right hand side containing buttons,
spinners and checkboxes.

To create a ROI, first select the type of ROI to draw by clicking one of the corresponding toolbar buttons in
ImageJ’s main window (any of the five buttons on the left, i.e Rectangle, Circular, Polygon.. etc, see the top right
window in the [[#Graphical Interface|OpenMIMS desktop screenshot]]). Then place the mouse over the area and drag the mouse while holding the left mouse button
down. When the left mouse button is released, the corresponding ROI will appear in all image windows as well as in
the list of ROIs in the ROI manager. Clicking on a previously drawn ROI in '''ROI Manager''' list will automatically
highlight the selected ROI in all mass, ratio, sum and HSI images.

The '''Groups''' list allows the user to organize ROIs into groups. The user can create new groups, delete existing
ones, and assign ROIs into groups. An ROI can only belong to a single group. Clicking on a group will reduce the
'''Rois''' list to only those ROIs belonging to that group. Clicking on the elipses group ('''...''') will always show all ROIs.

'''Delete''' will delete the selected ROIs in the ROI list. If none are selected then it will delete them all, after
prompting the user. '''Rename''' allows the user to rename the ROI from its default name. '''Open''' will open an ROI
file that had been saved from a previous session and overwrites the current list. Save will save a single ROI to a file
or a group of them to a .zip file. '''Measure''' will open a statistics box that will display statistics for all ROIs for the
current image. '''Deselect''' will deselect any ROIs that have been highlighted. The '''More>>''' button offers the user
some more complicated features relating to the combining and splitting ROIs. ROIs can be moved on a pixel by
pixel basis using the '''X Pos.''' and '''Y Pos.''' spinners. ROIs can also be moved by the user by dragging them across
the image with the mouse cursor. Adjusting the '''Width''' and '''Height''' spinners will adjust those values but only for
rectangular and circular ROIs.

If the user moves an ROI, it will move for all images in the stack unless the '''Move All''' checkbox is unchecked, in
which it will only be moved for the current plane. The user can choose to hide all ROIs by checking the '''Hide All'''
Rois checkbox or just hide the labels by checking the '''Hide Labels''' checkbox.

== Menu Items ==

This section provides a brief description of features provided in the menu items of the MIMS application.

=== File ===
; Open MIMS Image: This menu item will bring up a file chooser that allows the user to select which file should be opened. The plugin can read ''.im'' files and ''.nrrd'' files <ref>http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd </ref> (It can only open the ''.nrrd'' files that were generated by the plugin). Additionally it can open any ''.ratio'', ''.hsi'', and ''.sum'' file that was generated by the plugin when saving from a previous session.

; Save Image: This menu item will save whatever modifications have been made to the original ''.im'' file (translations, dropped planes, etc.) into a new binary file with a ''.nrrd'' file extension. The OpenMIMS plugin is capable of reading the both ''.im'' files and the ''.nrrd'' files that it generates.

; Save Session: This menu item is similar to the Save Image menu item however in this case additional files will be created for each ratio, hsi and sum image that is open at the time of saving. These files can be opened individually at a later date so long as the .nrrd file that was created with them is stored in the same directory.

; About OpenMIMS: Displays version and other information related to the OpenMIMS application.

; Exit: Exits the application. ImageJ stays open as well as all opened images.

=== Edit ===

; Preferences: Opens a dialog box which allows the user to set customized preferences.

; Restore Mims: This menu item will reset the current image to its original state, all translations will be set back to zero and all dropped images will be reinserted. Functionally it is the same as reopening the current image.

=== View ===

; Tile Windows: This menu item will take all of the currently open *image* windows and rearrange them in a grid on the desktop.

; ROI Manager: This menu item open the ROI Manager. The ROI manager will also open whenever a ROI is drawn.

Additional menu items are located here allowing the user to view or hide individual mass images.

=== Utilities === 

; Image Notes: Opens up a text area that allows user to enter notes regarding an image. These notes will be stored with other metadata when saving the file.

; Generate Report: Opens a dialog box which captures the current image and has a text area that allows the users to enter notes. When the user clicks OK a .rtf formated report is generated. Subsequent images and notes can be appended to the report. This functionality is useful for recording important information while analyzing images.

; Sum All Open: Generates a sum image for all open mass and ratio images. It will not generate a sum image for open HSI images. See the [[#Process|Process]] section to see how to generate sum images for HSI images.

; Import .im List: The OpenMIMS application has the ability to read a text file with a list of file names and it will open those image files, appending them to one another. *NOTE* ''All image files must exist in the same directory as the text file that references them''. An example image list file is provided in [[#Appendices|Appendix D]].

; Capture Current Image: Selecting this menu item will produce a screen capture of the the last image clicked by the user (whichever image has the current focus). The new image is an RGB image of exactly what is displayed on the screen, including things like ROI outlines.

; Batch convert to nrrd: Allows the user to batch convert a set of .im files into .nrrd files. Can also perform tracking of the image while converting.

; Export...> Export All Derived (png): Exports all derived images (ratio, HSI and sum images) as .png files.

; Close...> Close All Ratio Images: Closes all currently open ratio images.

; Close...> Close All HSI Images: Closes all currently open HSI images.

; Close...> Close All Sum Images: Closes all currently open sum images.

; Generate Stack: Generates a new ratio or HSI image with independent scrollbars rather than the single plane ratio or HSI images that are generated by default.

; Composite: Selecting this menu item will bring up a dialog which allows the user to quickly create a composite image with up to 4 channels. Any mass, sum, or ratio image can be used for the Red, Green, Blue, or Grey channels or a channel may be left blank. Each channel uses a simple color LUT. The min/max values for each LUT are taken from the underlying images. For example if the m26 mass image is used for the Red channel that channel will have the same min/max values. Changing the min/max values (or brightness/contrast) on the Contrast tab for the m26 image will automatically update the Red channel in the composite.

=== Corrections ===

; Apply dead time correction: Applies a dead time correction to the data. A 44 nanosecond correction is applied to the data.

; Apply QSA correction: Applies a QSA correction to the data. Applying the QSA correction automatically applies a dead correction.
