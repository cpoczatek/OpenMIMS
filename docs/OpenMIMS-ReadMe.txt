PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
==================================

 OpenMIMS version 1.4 (March 2011)

 OpenMIMS is an ImageJ plugin designed to open, process and analyze 
 images captured with NanoSIMS 50 & 50L secondary ion mass 
 spectrometers (Cameca).

 The OpenMIMS plugin has been developed at the National Resource for
 Imaging Mass Spectrometry (NRIMS, http://www.nrims.hms.harvard.edu), 
 an NIH-supported National Resource developing Multi-isotope Imaging 
 Mass Spectrometry (MIMS) for biomedical research. Images and/or 
 stacks of images of up to 7 different isotopes can be opened, 
 analyzed and saved. Image ratios and Hue-Saturation-Intensity (HSI) 
 maps of any combination of isotopes can be displayed and data from 
 any number of Regions of Interest (ROIs) extracted, analyzed and 
 tabulated for single images or entire stacks.

==================================
HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
==================================

 OpenMIMS is an ImageJ plugin. It will run on any system 
 running ImageJ 1.43u (or higher) and Java 1.6 (or higher). The 
 ImageJ application can be downloaded at the following location:

   http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html

 Additionally, due to the potentially large image sizes generated by 
 the NanoSIMS mass spectrometer, it is suggested that approximately 
 2G of memory be devoted to running the ImageJ application if the 
 OpenMIMS plugin is going to be used. This can be done by setting 
 the maximum Java heap size flag in the "run" file used to start 
 ImageJ, for example:

   java -Xmx2048m -jar ij.jar

==================================
CONTENTS AND INSTALLATION
==================================

 The contents of the Open_MIMS.zip file includes the following files:

   * jcommon-1.0.16.jar
   * jfreechart-1.0.13.jar
   * nrims_java_common.jar
   * Open_MIMS.jar
   * swing-layout-1.0.3.jar
   * Turbo_Reg.jar
   * commons-io-2.0.jar
   * README_OpenMIMS.txt
   * MimsManual.pdf

 To install the OpenMIMS plugin, extract the contents of the 
 Open_MIMS.zip file into the "plugins" directory under ImageJ. Only 
 the .jar files need to be the placed in the "plugins" directory. 
 The files README_OpenMIMS.txt and MimsManual.pdf are documentation 
 files and are not required by the OpenMIMS plugin.
 
 **IMPORTANT** Please delete any jar files that may already exist in 
 your "plugins" directory from any older versions of the OpenMIMS plugin.
 Having older libraries in the "plugins" directory can cause conflicts 
 within the software.
 
 Once the contents are copied over, restart ImageJ and "Open MIMS
 Image" should appear under Plugins menu in ImageJ.

 See MimsManual.pdf for a brief guide/manual on the OpenMIMS plugin.
