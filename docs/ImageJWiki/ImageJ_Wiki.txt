====== OpenMIMS ======

**OpenMIMS is an ImageJ plugin designed to open, process and analyze images captured with NanoSIMS 50 & 50L secondary ion mass spectrometers (Cameca).**

===== Introduction =====

The OpenMIMS plugin has been developed at the National Resource for
 Imaging Mass Spectrometry (NRIMS, http://www.nrims.hms.harvard.edu), 
 an NIH-supported National Resource developing Multi-isotope Imaging 
 Mass Spectrometry (MIMS) for biomedical research. Images and/or 
 stacks of images of up to 7 different isotopes can be opened, 
 analyzed and saved. Image ratios and Hue-Saturation-Intensity (HSI) 
 maps of any combination of isotopes can be displayed and data from 
 any number of Regions of Interest (ROIs) extracted, analyzed and 
 tabulated for single images or entire stacks.

===== Features =====
  - Open, process and analyze images captured with NanoSIMS 50 & 50L secondary ion mass spectrometers.
  - QSA and dead time correction.
  - Generates plots and tables for Regions of Interest (ROIs).
  - Generates reports.
  - Export images in png format.

===== Installation =====

To install the OpenMIMS plugin, extract the contents of the 
 [[http://www.nrims.harvard.edu/OpenMIMS.zip|Open_MIMS.zip]] file into the "plugins" directory under ImageJ. Only 
 the .jar files need to be the placed in the "plugins" directory. 
 The files README_OpenMIMS.txt and MimsManual.pdf are documentation 
 files and are not required by the OpenMIMS plugin.
 
 Once the contents are copied over, restart ImageJ or use the Update Menu command. "Open MIMS
 Image" should now appear under Plugins menu.
