# OpenMIMS

Hello world. We are in the process of moving our code and documentation to github. Please note that:
* Definative documentation is still at http://nrims.partners.org
* The svn repository (https://zoomwhee.mgh.harvard.edu/svn_devel/OpenMIMS/) is DEPRICATED and will soon disappear.

OpenMIMS is an ImageJ plugin to open, process and analyze images captured with NanoSIMS 50 & 50L secondary ion mass spectrometers (Cameca). The plugin has been developed at the National Resource for Imaging Mass Spectrometry (NRIMS, http://www.nrims.harvard.edu), an NIH-supported National Resource developing Multi-isotope Imaging Mass Spectrometry (MIMS) for biomedical research. Images and/or stacks of images for up to 7 different isotopes can be opened, analyzed and saved. All metadata saved in the original file are preserved. Image ratios and Hue-Saturation-Intensity (HSI) maps of any combination of isotopes can be displayed and data from any number of Regions of Interest (ROIs) extracted, analyzed and tabulated for single images or entire stacks.
